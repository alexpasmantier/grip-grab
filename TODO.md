- [x] async searching for results and displaying them in the UI
- [ ] async preview highlighting into cache and UI checks for cache (might be overkill)
- [ ] capping the number of results displayed in the UI (telescope does that) -> might allow caching all preview highlights ahead of time
- [x] displaying the current number of results found
- [x] scrolling problems (seems like the arithmetics are off)
- [ ] fuzzy search (other tool?)
- [x] navigation shortcuts for preview while in other panes
- [x] converting between syntec colors and ratatui colors for theme specification
- [ ] PR to ratatui for docstrings on constraints (should be characters instead of pixels)
